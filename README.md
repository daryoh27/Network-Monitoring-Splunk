# Network Monitoring using Splunk SIEM Tool

## Understanding Splunk as a SIEM Tool
Splunk is one of the most widely adopted Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms used by organizations to gain real-time visibility into their IT, security, and operational environments. Designed to collect, index, correlate, and analyze machine data from virtually any source, Splunk enables security teams to detect threats faster and respond more effectively.

Splunk aggregates logs from servers, endpoints, applications, firewalls, cloud services, and network devices. This consolidation creates a single source of truth for investigations and compliance reporting.

## Dashboards & Visualization
Custom dashboards provide clear insights into authentication patterns, high-risk events, network traffic anomalies, and overall security posture. Visualizations help teams quickly identify trends and potential vulnerabilities.

## Common Security Use Cases
- Monitoring Windows event logs (e.g., 4624, 4625, 4768)
- Detecting failed, successful or unusual login attempts
- Tracking privileged user activity
- Analyzing firewall or proxy traffic
- Detecting malware or suspicious processes
- Cloud security monitoring (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Insider threat detection
- SOC alerting & incident response

## Conclusion
Splunk stands out as a robust and flexible SIEM solution capable of meeting modern cybersecurity demands. Its ability to correlate large volumes of machine data, generate actionable insights, and support threat detection workflows makes it a critical tool for Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and IT security teams worldwide.
